# Title
Schooledia

# Motivation
As part of my CPQ Project, I decided to focus on the issues of social media in schools. Given that devices are typically banned in most UK Schools, we can expect most of this to be due to cyber bullying on social media as well as distractions.
Hence, I decided to make a simple "social media" site that works through a LAN Client-Server Network, with JavaScript operating on the client and Python on the server. The front end designed and coded on by me was done through HTML and CSS only. 
Making this a LAN software, teachers would be able to monitor and misbehaviour across social media and students would have the ability to communicate with each other.

# Aim
This project was to make me able to improve my coding proficiency in Python and learn JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 

# Function
By using the Websocket modules, async/await functions and promises in JavaScript and Python, I was able to create a Client-Server system efficiently. While doing this, I also developed some of my proficiency in HTML, CSS and how to style and design websites, inspired by the turqoise seasides and minimalist theme, I combined the two to produce Schooledia.
I used text files as a database, though we know we can simply just learn and use databases from other software, like SQL. This was simply an attempt to understand how databases function, to some depth.

# Potential Errors
When using the program make sure to replace "192.168.x.x" to the IP Address of the server.
Any occurances of ".../Schooledia.." needs to be replaced with the actual file path of that specified file.
